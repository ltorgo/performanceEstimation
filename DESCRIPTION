Title: An  Infra-Structure for Performance Estimation of Predictive Models
Description: An  infra-structure for estimating the predictive performance
    of predictive models. In this context, it can also be used to compare and/or select among
    different alternative ways of solving one or more predictive tasks. The main goal of the 
    package is to provide a generic infra-structure to estimate the values of different metrics
    of predictive performance using different estimation procedures. These estimation tasks can be
    applied to any solutions (workflows) to the predictive tasks. The package provides easy to use
    standard workflows that allow the usage of any available R modeling algorithm together with
    some pre-defined data pre-processing steps and also prediction post-processing methods. It also provides means for addressing issues related with the statistical significance of the observed differences.
